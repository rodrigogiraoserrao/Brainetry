# Brainetry

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/rojergs/brainetry)][replit]

## What is brainetry?

**Brainetry** is an esoteric programming language that was inspired by the [brainf*ck] and [poetic] programming languages.

Being an [esoteric programming language] means you will program in **brainetry** mostly for fun and not because you are writing real world applications.

**Brainetry** programs represent a superset of the programs one can write in brainf\*ck and that is **brainetry**'s main inspiration, the infinite tape with finite cell size model that brainf\*ck has.
Notice that brainf\*ck is [Turing complete] so **brainetry** is also Turing complete.
Poetic is a language that maps directly to brainf\*ck and where instructions are encoded in the size of the words, which is similar to **brainetry**, except in **brainetry** what matters is the size of the lines and possibly punctuation marks used in each line.

## Why brainetry?

Again, **brainetry** is an esoteric programming language so do not expect it to be the programming language in which you are going to write your next app with. You are free to give it a try, of course, and let me know how it goes!

Other than that, I will expect you to program in **brainetry** only for the fun of it.

I have found it to be very amuzing to write self-referential **brainetry** programs, often programs that explain themselves.

## Get started!

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/rojergs/brainetry)][replit]

To get started you can run **brainetry** programs right from your web browser, just click the badge above or follow [this link][replit]. Write your **brainetry** program in the `btry\replit.btry` file and press the green "Run" button.

You can also clone this repository and use the CLI tool provided to run **brainetry** programs, just open your command prompt and type the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/rojergs/brainetry
cd brainetry
./cli.py btry/hello_world.btry
```
